# Pointers
## Aim
To swap functions using call by refrence and call by value method using pointers.
## Theory
Pointers in C language is a variable that stores/points the address of another variable. A Pointer in C is used to allocate memory dynamically i.e. at run time. The pointer variable might be belonging to any of the data type such as int, float, char, double, short etc. There are two ways to pass arguments/parameters to function calls -- call by value and call by reference. The major difference between call by value and call by reference is that in call by value a copy of actual arguments is passed to respective formal arguments. While, in call by reference the location (address) of actual arguments is passed to formal arguments, hence any change made to formal arguments will also reflect in actual arguments. 
## Conclusion
In this practical, we learnt about the two methods to call a function, the difference between them and how to use them. We laernt about the concept of actual and formal parameters. We also used pointers in call by refrence.
